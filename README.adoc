This repository hosts the source for the https://docs-as-co.de website.
It is based on

* Jekyl as static site generator
* AsciiDoc as markup language
* https://jaxenter.de/hitchhikers-guide-docs-code-asciidoctor-jekyll-73753[this Java Magazin article] on how to implement it

Since github does not support AsciiDoc for github pages, the website is hosted at https://netlify.com .
