= Tutorial: add docToolchain as submodule
include::feedback.adoc[]

// numbering from here on
:numbered:

This short tutorial will show you how to add docToolchain as git submodule.

== Motivation

Git submodules are references to a certain commit of another git repository.
This makes submodules perfect to include repositories -- on which your own project depends -- into your project without copying them.
Since a submodule is a pointer to a certain commit, it is also easy to update this pointer when a newer version is available.

== What you'll build

In this tutorial, you will create a simple gradle project with a single `.adoc` file.
To this project, you'll add docToolchain to generate an HTML file and a PDF.

== What you'll need

* 20(?) minutes
* a windows or *nix based machine
* a text editor or IDE
* jdk 1.8 installed
* git installed
* gradle installed

the commands needed to go through this tutorial will be bash based.
So if you are on a windows environment, please make sure that you start a bash
or translate the commands for yourself - I am sure this will be a no-brainer.

== Create a simple project to start with

create a new folder and switch to it

    mkdir tutorial1
    cd tutorial1

init git (it's a new project!) and create a simple folder structure for your documents

    git init
    mkdir src
    mkdir src/docs

create a simple `.adoc` file.
To make it simple, just fetch one from the net via curl

    curl -o src/docs/test.adoc https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mojavelinux/4402636/raw/b8b02adc3c0ddb92df505ba3eb8e625952615b7a/test.asciidoc.txt

and since this great test document includes another document, let's fetch this also

    curl -o src/docs/include.asciidoc.txt https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mojavelinux/4402636/raw/b8b02adc3c0ddb92df505ba3eb8e625952615b7a/include.asciidoc.txt

The main file `./src/docs/test.adoc` contains a reference to a stylesheet which is not available, so please open it in your favourite editor (vi?) and remove the reference (`:stylesheet: asciidoc.css` in line 17)

    vi src/docs/test.adoc

Since we like Gradle projects, let's initialize the toplevel project (`tutorial1`) as gradle project.
This will make docToolchain a subproject.

    gradle init

and

    gradle wrapper

for convenience.
That's it!

.use the wrapper, luke!
****

Don't have gradle installed?

Just first add docToolchain as submodule (next step) and then do

    cd docToolchain
    ./gradlew -p .. init
    ./gradlew -p .. wrapper

 This will use the gradle wrapper contained in docToolchain to initialize your main project
 and it will also install the wrapper to that you don't need to install gradle by yourself.

Alternatively use https://sdkman.io[sdkman]
****

INFO: if you need to configure proxies and repository caches (artifactory) for Gradle to fetch external dependencies, please take a look at this blog post: https://docs-as-co.de/news/enterprise-edition/[Behind the great Firewall]

For a real project, you now would add some source code and more build instructions.
To render the document with docToolchain, we only need the document itself.

== add docToolchain as submodule

In order to add docToolchain as submodule, you just have to execute the following command

    git submodule add https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain.git

TIP: use https and not the ssh to clone the submodule. This enables anonymous clones.

Add docToolchain as sub-project to your main project by adding an include to the `settings.gradle` file

    echo "include 'docToolchain'" >> settings.gradle

If you now list all tasks of your project, gradle will pick up the docToolchain build file from the subproject,
download all dependencies and output the list of available tasks and fail with an exception:

    ./gradlew tasks

    FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
    * Where:
    Script '/home/docToolchain/tutorial1/docToolchain/scripts/AsciiDocBasics.gradle' line: 25
    * What went wrong:
    A problem occurred evaluating script.
    > ./Config.groovy (No such file or directory)

That's correct -- docToolchain needs a configuration file!

Let's create an empty one and see how this works:

.bash
[source, bash, role="primary"]
----
    touch Config.groovy
    ./gradlew tasks
----

et voilÃ¡, you get a list of all available tasks:

.bash
[source, bash, role="primary"]
----
> Task :tasks

All tasks runnable from root project

...

To see all tasks and more detail, run gradle tasks --all

To see more detail about a task, run gradle help --task <task>

----

As you can see, you now have already a lot of documentation tasks at hand.

== setting up the configuration

create a simple `Config.groovy` file to start with:

.Config.groovy
[source, groovy, role="primary"]
----
outputPath = 'build/docs'

// Path where the docToolchain will search for the input files.
// This path is appended to the docDir property specified in gradle.properties
// or in the command line, and therefore must be relative to it.
inputPath = 'src/docs'

inputFiles = [
              [file: 'test.adoc',            formats: ['html','pdf']],
             ]

taskInputsDirs = ["${inputPath}/images"]

taskInputsFiles = []

----

And since we want to use our main project to be the source of the documentation, we have to tell docToolchain where it can find it. Since we don't want to touch the original docToolchain sources, we override the config via the `build.gradle` file.
Just add the following lines to your `build.gradle`.
Since we have an empty main project in this tutorial, you can even overwrite the whole `build.gradle` with the following lines:

(it instructs docToolchain to use the main project as starting point for all other configurations (like the one we just defined in `Config.groovy`))

.build.gradle
[source, groovy, role="primary"]
----
//configure docToolchain to use the main project's config
project('docToolchain') {                                   // <1>
    if (project.hasProperty('docDir')) {                    // <2>
        docDir = '../.'                                     // <4>
        mainConfigFile = 'Config.groovy'                    // <5>
    } else {
        println "="*80                                      // <3>
        println "  please initialize the docToolchain submodule"
        println "  by executing git submodule update -i"
        println "="*80
    }
}
----

<1> changes the scope to docToolchain as subproject
<2> checks if the subproject has been initialized
<3> outputs a hint if subproject has not been initialized
<4> moves the base folder for docToolchain to the main project folder
<5> this enables you to point docToolchain to your own config file
