teach someone how to fish and she has food for a lifetime."

== Get Started... Quickly

There are several ways to getting started with the Docs-as-Code approach.

We'll show you how to create and render a simple AsciiDoc document:

. [Zero-Dependency Approach] +
try it out without installing anything using an online-editor
. The Editor Approach
. The Build Tool Approach: Integrate Docs-As-Code into your build process.

=== The Zero-Dependencies Approach

You just want to give AsciiDoc a try without installing anything?

Go to https://asciidoclive.com/[AsciiDocLIVE] to try an online editor with preview.

=== The Editor Approach

If you are willing to install an editor or a plugin for your favorite IDE, you can install one of the following:

* https://asciidocfx.com/[AsciiDocFX], a full blown AsciiDoc editor.
* https://atom.io/users/asciidoctor[Atom] editor with AsciiDoc plugin.
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaompinto.asciidoctor-vscode[Visual Studio Code] with AsciiDoc support.
* https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391-asciidoc[IntelliJ] with AsciiDoc support.
* https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/asciidoctor-editor[Eclipse] with AsciiDoc support.

=== The Build-Tool Approach

"You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door."footnote:[If you are born after 1980 - this is a famous quote from Zork-1, a text adventure created by Infocom]

There is a *Maven*, a *Gradle* and a *Command-Line-Tool* nearby.

What will you choose?

.Command-Line
[role='primary']
--

.> use Command-Line-Tool

You install *asciidoctorj* via https://sdkman.io[sdkman] and write your first simple AsciiDoc document

.test.adoc
[source]
----
== Headline

first paragraph

second paragraph

=== second level headline

a link: https://docs-as-co.de[docs-as-co.de]
----


You then convert it via

    asciidoctorj test.adoc

.Maven
[role='secondary']
--

.> use Maven

You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

You install *Maven* via https://sdkman.io[sdkman] and write your first simple AsciiDoc document

.test.adoc
[source]
----
== Headline

first paragraph

second paragraph

=== second level headline

a link: https://docs-as-co.de[docs-as-co.de]
----

You then download the build file from github, because it is too big to be just typed in:

.maven.pom footnote:[taken from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-examples/master/asciidoc-to-html-example/pom.xml]
[source,xml]
----
include::_pages/getstarted/maven.pom[]
----


...and convert your document via

    mvn

video::VCaI8DGb0vU[youtube, width=512px, height=384px]
--

.Gradle
[role='secondary']
--

.> use Gradle

Good choice!
A fairy appears and grants you a wish.
You wish for a very simple build file and the following line of text appears:

.gradle.build
[source,groovy]
----
plugins { id "org.asciidoctor.convert" version "1.5.3" }
----

you write your very first AsciiDoc document and put it in `/src/docs/asciidoc/`

.test.adoc
[source]
----
== Headline

first paragraph

second paragraph

=== second level headline

a link: https://docs-as-co.de[docs-as-co.de]
----

You install Gradle via https://sdkman.io[sdkman]
and convert the file with

    gradle asciidoc

a nicely styled html file appears in `/build/asciidoc/html5/.`
