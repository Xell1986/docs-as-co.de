= Quickstart

There are several ways to get quickly started with the Docs-as-Code approach.

The Quickstart basically consists of creating and rendering your first AsciiDoc document.

== The Zero-Dependencies Approach

You just want to give AsciiDoc a try without installing anything?

Go to https://asciidoclive.com/[AsciiDocLIVE] and use an online editor with preview.

== The Editor Approach

If you are willing to install an editor or a plugin for your favorite IDE, you can install one of the following editors with the corresponding plugins:

* AsciiDocFX
* Atom
* Visual Studio Code
* Netbeans
* IntelliJ
* Eclipse

=> see also Article in JavaMagazin

== The Build-Tool Approach

You are standing west of a white house.
There is a *Maven*, a *Gradle* and a *Command-Line-Tool* nearby.

What will you choose?

.Command-Line
[role='primary']
--

.> use Command-Line-Tool

You install *asciidoctorj* via https://sdkman.io[sdkman] and write your first simple AsciiDoc document

.test.adoc
[source]
----
== Headline

first paragraph

second paragraph

=== second level headline

a link: https://docs-as-co.de[docs-as-co.de]
----


You then convert it via

    asciidoctorj test.adoc

.Maven
[role='secondary']
--

.> use Maven

you are likely to be eaten by a grue.

You install *Maven* via https://sdkman.io[sdkman] and write your first simple AsciiDoc document

.test.adoc
[source]
----
== Headline

first paragraph

second paragraph

=== second level headline

a link: https://docs-as-co.de[docs-as-co.de]
----

You then copy and paste the build file, because it is too big to by just typed in:

.maven.pom
[source,xml]
----
----

...and convert your document via

    mvn asciidoc

--

.Gradle
[role='secondary']
--

.> use Gradle

Good choice!
A fairy appears and grants you a wish.
You wish for a very simple build file and the following line of text appears:

.gradle.build
[source,groovy]
----
plugins { id "org.asciidoctor.convert" version "1.5.3" }
----

you write your very first AsciiDoc document and put it in `/src/docs/asciidoc/`

.test.adoc
[source]
----
== Headline

first paragraph

second paragraph

=== second level headline

a link: https://docs-as-co.de[docs-as-co.de]
----

You install Gradle via https://sdkman.io[sdkman]
and convert the file with

    gradle asciidoc

a nicely styled html file appears in `/build/asciidoc/html5/.`
