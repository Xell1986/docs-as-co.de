Why docs-as-code?
Have you ever been annoyed by having to switch tools when you want to document your code?
Did you ever wish to update all the diagrams in your documentation easily?
Did you ever wish to have an easy review process for your documents?
Would you like to have your code and documentation in sync?
If you can answer one or more of these questions with "yes", then the docs-as-code approach is for you!

With docs-as-code, you treat your documentation in the same way as your code. 

You use... 
your  IDE to write it
your version control system to store and version it 
your test-runner to test it
your build system to build and deploy it
If this sounds good to you, then read on!

a note before you begin
When you read through our pages, articles, presentations, you will soon notice that what you read here is a bit opinionated and from the view of a techie.
Docs-as-Code is an approach practiced by many people with different tools. One notable group is the group of technical writers whose community can be found at http://writethedocs.org.
 
Concepts

When you treat your docs as code, you will need to master certain skills and implement specific concepts. But don't worry, these skills and concepts are not new to you. You already know them from your daily coding and now you will also use them for your documents.

A suitable format
