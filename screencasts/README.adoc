= Screencasts

This file contains some autoit scripts to automate the generation of screencasts.

If you want to run them, here are some notes:

In order to capture several windows in the same video, they have to be opened as fullscreen.
Otherwise the might not open in the capture region.
To achieve this, connect a low res display (1024x768) as second display.

I use camtasia as recorder.
Before you start the script, open the camtasia recorder and set the capture region to the second screen.

The scripts might be currently a bit fragile.
The trigger on the existence of a java-process.
So make sure that no other java process is running when yous tart the script.
The also expect that the windows will open on the right screen.
It might be that you have to adjust this.
